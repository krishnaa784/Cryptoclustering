# Crypto Clustering

This project uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze and cluster cryptocurrencies based on market performance and other features.

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA)
- hvPlot
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Project Overview

The objective is to use K-Means clustering to identify patterns among cryptocurrencies, comparing results using both original and PCA-reduced feature sets.

### Key Steps:
1. Preprocessing crypto market data
2. Dimensionality reduction with PCA
3. Clustering with K-Means
4. Elbow method to determine optimal `k`
5. Visualizing clusters with hvPlot
